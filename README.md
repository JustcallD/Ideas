# Ideas
1. Digital Witness for Road Accidents
✅ U.S.: Nexar Dashcam, Open Witness

❌ India: People flee the scene out of fear; victims get no support

🔥 Opportunity: App that auto-records road incidents and uploads encrypted footage if triggered by sound/speed

📈 13. "MaidFund" – SIP Tool for Domestic Workers
🧹 Problem: Maids earn cash, spend it all, have no safety net.

🧠 Idea: Employer-linked tool that lets them save ₹10–₹100/day into mutual funds or digital gold.

🔥 Market: 1.4 crore+ domestic helpers — no financial literacy, huge trust gap
